# Overview

This is a basic command-line version of hangman written in Rust. As a software engineer I am trying to learn new skills, languages, and expand my knowledge. My purpose for writing this was to learn the syntax of Rust and write some simple beginner code. This program implements, lists, counters, loops, and package configurations. 

You can watch a demo of my software here:
